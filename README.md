# DS5110 - Final Project - Julian Baker & Konstantinos Theodoropoulos
End-to-end data science project: Wildfire analysis and prediction using a structured SQL database and exploratory data analysis.

SQL Database Information

The full SQLite database file is not included in this repository because its size exceeds GitHub’s 25MB upload limit.
Instead, this repo provides schema.sql, an entity relationship diagram, and CSV files with the data. This is everything needed to recreate the database structure.
