# DS5110 - Final Project - Julian Baker & Konstantinos Theodoropoulos
End-to-end data science project: Wildfire analysis and prediction using a structured SQL database and exploratory data analysis.



        The goal of your project

        How to run your code (step-by-step)

        Any requirements or dependencies

        A brief explanation of your approach/methodology

Note: The full SQLite database file is not included in this repository because its size exceeds GitHub’s 25MB upload limit.
Instead, this repo provides schema.sql, an entity relationship diagram, and CSV files with the data (compressed). This is everything needed to recreate the database structure.
