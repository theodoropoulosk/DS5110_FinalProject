# DS5110 - Final Project - Julian Baker & Konstantinos Theodoropoulos
End-to-end data science project: Wildfire analysis and prediction using a structured SQL database and exploratory data analysis.



        The goal of your project

        How to run your code (step-by-step)

        Any requirements or dependencies

        A brief explanation of your approach/methodology

        Any results, outputs, or demos (include screenshots if needed)

To run the notebook section of this project, for the file merge step, download the datasets from the source (as github did not store the full dataset due to it's size):
(insert links)

From there, download the notebook section into google drive alongside the datasets. 
Then, change the paths in the code to match where the files are located.
For example, in the data merging file, change this line:
df_canada = pd.read_csv('/content/gdrive/MyDrive/DS 5110 Final Project/Data to use/NFDB_point_20240613.csv')
To the path of where the data is located in your drive. 

The results should appear when you first load in the ipynb files.





Note: The full SQLite database file is not included in this repository because its size exceeds GitHub’s 25MB upload limit.
Instead, this repo provides schema.sql, an entity relationship diagram, and CSV files with the data (compressed). This is everything needed to recreate the database structure.
